        "As you probably know by now, BERT is a transformed-based, context-sensitive, neural language models that has been trained, among others, on a masked language modeling task, where the model learns to predict what the most likely word is at a a *masked* (hidden) position in the sentence. In a sentence like:\n",

The model uses both the right and left context of the masked position to make its predictions. Models trained to maximize the probability of predicting the correct masked words learn to represent a good amount of linguistic knowledge as a result of this.\n",

In the example above, for instance, the masked position can be filled by a plural noun (*problems*) but not by a singular noun (*problem*). If the model makes predictions that respect the linguistic constraints, we have reason to believe that the model is somehow aware of the linguistic structure of the language.\n",

Think of cases where the context makes it clear that the mask has to be plural or singular, that a verb has to have a particular form (like plural or singular, or participle or infinitive), that a specific (personal, possessive, reflexive) pronoun has to be used, that an adjective or noun has to have a specific inflection (like in German and more generally in languages with a rich case and/or gender marking system). There is a host of literature on this, see for instance [Marvin and Linzen](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09031) (for English) and [Sahin et al](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/coli_a_00376) (for multilingual probes).\n",

This means that you do not have to choose examples from English, but that you may also present a probe for another language.\n",

The pipeline can be used to test masked language model prediction. Given a sequence containing the special token [MASK], the model will predict what the most likely tokens are at that position, using both left and right context."
